A Skellington karma bot where things only get better.


## Awarding karma

You can award karma with `username++` or `@username++`.

## Removing karma

Nope, not a thing. Move on. Nothing to see here.

## How much karma do I have?

You can ask the bot how much karma a user has with `@bot karma @username` or `@bot karma username`.

Or if you are feeling more private you can ask in a direct message.
